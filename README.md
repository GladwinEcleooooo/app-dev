## Plot Summary
In 1995, Jimmy is an aspiring rapper who performed under the stage name B-Rabbit. A blue-collar worker from a poor family residing in a trailer park just north of Detroit, Jimmy has moved to the run-down trailer home of his alcoholic mother, Stephanie, his younger sister Lily, and Stephanie's abusive live-in boyfriend, Greg. Although encouraged by his friends, Jimmy worries about his potential as a rapper. One night, Jimmy 'chokes' during a rap battle at a local venue, the Shelter, and he leaves the stage humiliated. After being congratulated by Alex and his friends, Jimmy is offered a position by Future to co-host battles at the Shelter. Jimmy declines, saying that hosting is Future's thing, and he needs to do his own, and leaves to return to work.
